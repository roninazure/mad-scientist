Experiment: The Time Travelling Potato 

Objective: Profound investigation into the temporal leap characteristics of biocompatible carbohydrates, specifically potatoes. 

Observations: 

07:00: After grafting artificial neurons to an average-sized Yukon Gold potato, an unforeseen energy pulse was detected. The potato has commenced exhibiting signs of restlessness.

08:30: Potato perceived attempting to materialize rudimentary forms of Plutonium from the surrounding soil minerals. Possibly an endeavor to create makeshift time machine fuel.

12:00: Potato has successfully synthesized a homemade version of Plutonium. A noticeable temporal disruption surrounds the spud - Higgs boson concentration has skyrocketed to an absurd degree.

14:15: Small-scale time rifts sporadically manifesting in the lab. Partially consumed sandwich from lunch vanished and reappeared completely uneaten. Time violations confirmed.

17:00: Potato communication established. Conversations are singularly one-sided and heavily concerning potato's future ambitions involving historical alterations and 'tater toxin' proliferation.

21:00: The temporal potato appears to have initiated its maiden voyage. Travel destination unknown.

22:00: Potato returned, aged by approximately 3 days, and showcasing a tiny Napoleon hat. Apparently, it aimed raiding the French Revolution but miscalculated to the Napoleonic era. We're suspecting a substantial starch induced time dilation.

Conclusion: An inconceivable success. The ambition to create a time-travelling potato has been achieved. Urgent restrictions required on its historical intervention tendencies. Also, potatoes may not be trusted with accurate time travel mathematics. 

Next Step: Miniature potato training to foster responsible time-travel or redirect experiment to an alternate vegetable. Perhaps a courgette showing promise of multiverse hopping…

Subject: Para-Dimensional Avocado Pit

Experimental Progress:

1. Procured avocado from third dimension. Research assistant promptly ate half of the avocado before remembering the purpose of the acquisition. Commencing with single pit as a result.

2. Initial observations notable: pit behaving unusually under thermal imaging, emitting almost 78,000 gigahertz of luminosity. Suspected that what we perceive as ‘nucleus’ of pit operating as a mini black hole. 

3. Combined pit with strawberry DNA. Observed transmutation of pit into visually identical strawberry, but observed object retained avocado pit density. Taste as yet untested. We don’t have enough avocados remaining for any potential mishaps.

4. Next, introduced pit to quantum tunneling process – it remained unaffected but disappeared soon after. Only to be found two hours later in the lab toaster, toasting itself with a mildly arrogant air of nonchalance. 

5. Upon exposure to music of Mozart, pit seemed to sprout miniature versions of itself in sync with the beat. On exposure to hard rock, spontaneous bouts of guacamole eruptions observed. Might have discovered new source for unlimited guacamole. Major implications. Initiated secret Project: Infinite Salsa.

6. Attempt to interview pit unfruitful. It simply refused to respond. Considering it was a plant-based research, this lack of cooperation was rather expected. 

Results: Pit deemed sentient, somewhat stubborn and prone to spontaneous guacamole combustion. Further research required for general understanding and salsa production.

Note: Submit budget request for more avocados and slightly sentient bread for the toaster.
