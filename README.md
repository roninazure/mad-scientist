Date: Unknown

Experiment Name: High-Speed, Anti-Gravity Bagel Motors 

Initial Objective: To explore the feasibility of utilizing toasted bagels as an alternative energy source for trans-dimensional automobiles. 

Procedure: Phase 1 involved attaching 100% whole grain bagels to a prototype engine assembled from recycled vending machines and discontinued cassette Tape players. Next, the bagels were toasted within an atomically-powered bagel-o-matic toaster, then smeared with strawberry cream cheese synthesized from a neon gas sample extracted from the Aldebaran-4 nebula. The infused bagels were then mounted onto the Axle of Improbability and connected to the Quantum Cream Cheese Propulsion System. 

Observations: Upon ignition, the bagels rapidly rotated, producing an unusual pattern of neon-hued buttery sparks and blue garlic fumes. This triggered a quantum leap, and the engine phased into and out of our dimensional space-time coordinates. Both the lab table and the defunct coffee machine vanished during this process. Subsequent investigation found both items reappeared 100 miles away, floating in mid-air, and an army of cloned lab rats –– evidently brought into existence by a heretofore innocent-looking bagel guest –– were having a raucous party around them.

Conclusion: Although initially promising, using bagels as power sources resulted in unanticipated sub-atomic jumps and mass rodent cloning incidents. More testing may be necessary, ideally away from important furniture and major cities.

Further Action: Temporarily halt bagel-based power experiments. Future research can explore alternatives such as crumpet cold fusion or muffin vortex generators. Need to fetch lab furniture and address the unexpected rat problem.

Potential Implications for Science: Though riddled with uncertainty, today's fiasco raised some intriguing questions about reality, matter displacement, and Rodent Party Behavior. Careful honing of bagel-based tech could enable practical joke applications, cutting-edge pest control, or even the remote transportation of office furniture.
