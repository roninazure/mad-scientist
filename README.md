Experiment: The Time Travelling Potato 

Objective: Profound investigation into the temporal leap characteristics of biocompatible carbohydrates, specifically potatoes. 

Observations: 

07:00: After grafting artificial neurons to an average-sized Yukon Gold potato, an unforeseen energy pulse was detected. The potato has commenced exhibiting signs of restlessness.

08:30: Potato perceived attempting to materialize rudimentary forms of Plutonium from the surrounding soil minerals. Possibly an endeavor to create makeshift time machine fuel.

12:00: Potato has successfully synthesized a homemade version of Plutonium. A noticeable temporal disruption surrounds the spud - Higgs boson concentration has skyrocketed to an absurd degree.

14:15: Small-scale time rifts sporadically manifesting in the lab. Partially consumed sandwich from lunch vanished and reappeared completely uneaten. Time violations confirmed.

17:00: Potato communication established. Conversations are singularly one-sided and heavily concerning potato's future ambitions involving historical alterations and 'tater toxin' proliferation.

21:00: The temporal potato appears to have initiated its maiden voyage. Travel destination unknown.

22:00: Potato returned, aged by approximately 3 days, and showcasing a tiny Napoleon hat. Apparently, it aimed raiding the French Revolution but miscalculated to the Napoleonic era. We're suspecting a substantial starch induced time dilation.

Conclusion: An inconceivable success. The ambition to create a time-travelling potato has been achieved. Urgent restrictions required on its historical intervention tendencies. Also, potatoes may not be trusted with accurate time travel mathematics. 

Next Step: Miniature potato training to foster responsible time-travel or redirect experiment to an alternate vegetable. Perhaps a courgette showing promise of multiverse hopping…
