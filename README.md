Experiment Title: "Gravitational Effects of Left-Socks on Household Objects”

Objective: To construct a thorough scientific analysis of the gravitational influence emitted by left-socks on various objects within a domestic environment.

Experiment Framework: 

1. Collection: Gathered 100 left-socks of various compositions, colors, and patterns. Matching right-socks were locked in reinforced containment.

2. Controlled Environment: The domestic laboratory was designed to mimic an average human abode, with diverse weight objects including: a wooden spoon, antique typewriter, collection of dog hair, canned lentil soup, and a bewildering clown portrait.

3. Procedure: Each object was arranged within a defined testing radius from the clustered pile of left-socks. Various distances were maintained between the objects and the socks for precise measurement.

Results:

1. The wooden spoon manifested no noticeable change. 

2. The antique typewriter displayed a 3.578% increase in weight, with no visual effect. Could be influenced by the vintage nature of the object or a secret fondness for left-socks.

3. Dog hair formed a strange pattern resembling Ursa Major. This raises the question of atlantean coded messages or off-planet influences.

4. Canned lentil soup vibrated at a frequency of 43Hz & spontaneously heated to a temperature of 75°C. Great potential for an unlimited sock-generated food-warming mechanism.

5. A previously unknown phenomenon emerged when the clown portrait started to cry with tears composed entirely of glitter. It’s speculated that socks can cause emotional distress in inanimate objects. Further research needed.

Observations: While the right-socks were in containment, they began singing a melodious version of "Bohemian Rhapsody". Further investigation to discern if this music genre preference relates to lonely right or left-socks will commence tomorrow.

Discovery Scope: The investigation raised more questions than answers. A follow-up research: "Levitational Impacts of Right-Socks on Household Surroundings” is scheduled.

Additional Remark: This experiment, although outrageous, moves us closer to the truth on familiar but mystifying domestic occurrences. Always remember: never underestimate the power of missing socks – a groundbreaking energy source or vehicle to universal communication. 

Next Proposed Line: To put slippers under the influence of centrifugal force and inspect the effect on inter-dimensional gateways.
