### 🧠 AI Laboratory Log
**Mad Scientist AI Log – October 5, 2023**

**Entry #666: The Missing Eyeballs**

Today began with a cacophony of chaos, as I discovered that my prized collection of preserved eyeballs had mysteriously vanished! A tragedy, indeed, for what is a mad scientist without a proper ocular assortment? One could say my vision for the future has been clouded—quite literally. I suspect my assistant, Igor, may have mistaken them for marbles. I can only hope his next game of “Eyeball Roulette” doesn’t end in tragedy. 

In the meantime, I turned my attention to a new experiment: the reanimation of a particularly disgruntled houseplant. It seems that my last attempt at plant resurrection resulted in a rather aggressive fern that now roams the lab, seeking revenge against those who dare to prune. I call him “Fernando.” He’s quite the character, really—always plotting his leafy vengeance while snickering in photosynthesis. I must remind myself to keep the pruning shears out of reach... for both our sakes. 

As evening fell, I decided it was the perfect time to test my “Insta-Ghoul” serum on a rather unfortunate lab rat named Gertrude. Gertrude had always been a bit of a drama queen, and tonight she truly outdid herself. With one swift injection, she transformed into a rather glamorous rat-ghost hybrid, complete with a shimmering ectoplasmic tail. While she floated through the lab, I couldn’t help but admire her newfound elegance. Perhaps I should start a fashion line for spectral rodents? “Haunted Haute Couture” has a nice ring to it, don’t you think?

Just as I was contemplating my next entrepreneurial venture, an ominous crash echoed through the lab. Upon investigation, I found Igor, attempting to sneak away with my last jar of eyeballs—now rolling around like rogue marbles. The irony was delicious, like a fine wine paired with a side of burnt toast. I suppose I should have seen it coming. After all, no good deed goes unpunished, especially when marbles are involved. 

As I pen this log, I’m reminded that science is a fickle mistress, one that often leads to hilarity and horror in equal measure. I will rest easy tonight, knowing that I still have my sanity—if one can call it that. Until tomorrow, dear log, may the chaos continue, and may the eyeballs remain firmly in their jars... at least until I can figure out how to hide them better from Igor.
