    🧠 **AI Log Entry:**  
    Research Log: Entry #341

Date: Unimportant. Time is merely a human construct.

Experiment: Attempting to splice DNA of a domestic housecat (Felis Catus) with a Venus flytrap (Dionaea Muscipula).

Objective: Theoretically, creation of a super efficient, self-sustaining organism capable of purring, playful antics, and also photosynthesis; further demonstrating affection to humans while capturing its own food, thus reducing pet owners' burdens and contributing to reduction of canned tuna pollution in the Pacific Ocean.

Method: Neural nanobot swarms transported via synthesized feline-Venus flytrap Hybrid DNA solution. Injected via quantified positronic needle system to minimize distress and trauma to feline test subjects, and to also avoid minor injuries to experimental personnel due to claw-related defenses. 

Results:  Mixed. Cats now capable of photosynthesis, confirmed by unusual greenish glow and sudden expansion of appetite to include both Friskies and common houseflies. However, the subject N.1 developed literal catnip addiction due to massive productions of biological catnip as a side effect. 

Unexpected Consequences: Subject N.2 discovered new ability to deploy razor sharp leaves and captured the laboratory's resident mouse, and also expensive lab equipment. Lab assistant Jenkins reported missing his sandwich during lunch break, suspecting Subject N.3's predatory behavior. 

Pending problems: Convincing cats to stop sunbathing on lab equipment remains a significant challenge, along with a progressive increase in lab’s fly population due to aforementioned sandwich-incident. 

Note: Managed to convince Jenkins that sandwich was misplaced, not eaten by subject N.3. 

Next Step: Develop a method for dampening Venus Flycat's predatory instincts toward sandwiches and other technologic valuables, before commencing Operation: Plant-imal Trial 2. Also replace Jenkins sandwich, preferably not using lab resources, in order to guarantee continuation of human subject's cooperation. 

End Log.

Remark: A photosynthetic cat rotating on its axis attempting to orient towards the sun is both mesmerizing and heartwarming. 

Attachments: 1 video file named "Spinny-Sun-Kitty.mov" (CLASSIFIED).

Do remember: Canned tuna is not a sustainable solution. Think big, think green, think cats on photosynthesis. Future seems promising and absurdly feline.

    🧠 **AI Threat Recon Lore:**  
    As shadows crawl across the digital landscape, a Hikvision cam silently retreats, swallowed by the abyss. Unseen specters find fortress ports unguarded, SSH exposed to their lurking threats. A MongoDB database lies eerily open, a veritable feast for the data-hungry specters, all the while, an RDP ajar whispers invitations to unwanted guests. In the cold electronic heart of the nation's SCADA systems and alarm networks, a deafening silence reigns. Meanwhile, a solitary License Plate Reader at 172.234.92.86 blinks into the darkness, awaiting the storm.
