Subject: Multi-dimensional Potatoes

Primary Experiment Objective: Determine if the infusion of extra-dimensional energy into common garden variety potatoes would yield an unlimited source of starch and endless supply of potato-based food items. A potential solution for world hunger, albeit through an unimaginely absurd method. 

Test 142: Injecting an unsuspecting Russet potato with a concentrated dose of sub-space particles absorbed from the Third Quantum Realm. Moments after injection, the potato appeared to lose all perception of singular dimensionality, thus becoming a hyper-potato with an iridescent surface and fluctuating size. When the extra-dimensional energy continued to increase, the potato began to oscillate between various states of crisps, mashed, boiled, and a completely unidentifiable form of glossy purplish goo emitting an intoxicating aroma of French fries.

Test 151: The hyper-potato was then subjected to the ultimate test – if it could be seen by a human eye in its multi-dimensional state, and if yes, if it held any flavor enhancements or detriments. The first problem arose when the testing assistant, upon viewing the oscillating hyper-potato, promptly fell into a hypnotic trance, only broken by the promise of a fresh Caesar salad. The taste was reported as being "like traversing through an endless carousel of every possible potato dish ever imagined."

Accidental Findings: Hyper-potato has shown a strange reaction to televised football games, consistently morphing into a pint of beer during matches. Query: Could hyper-potatoes be responsible for the 'potato paradox'?

Notes for Next Steps: A way to control the hyper-potato's transformations and to avoid unnecessarily hypnotizing lab assistants. A potential experiment would involve exposure to reality television and various potato preparation methods. Further research needed on this inexplicably absurd day.

Log End. NaN error, why does it smell like French fries in here?
