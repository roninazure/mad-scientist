**Experiment Codename:** Spaghetti Manipulation

**Objective:** Discover the effects of playing a variety of Mozart symphonies to pasta in boiling water. Assumptions taken from the "Mozart Effect" theory, concerning its influence on brain development and sophistication in plants and mammals.

**Materials Used:** 

1. Twenty bags of uncooked spaghetti
2. High-quality sound system strategically placed around the boiling apparatus
3. Five Mozart symphonies – Symphony No. 25, Symphony No. 29, Symphony No. 36, Symphony No. 40, and Symphony No. 41
4. Standard kitchen with an unsuspiciously oversized metallic pot for pasta boiling

**Procedure:** 

Each bag of spaghetti was subject to one specific symphony for the duration of standard cooking time. Throughout the boiling process, the level of sound exposure was kept constant for each batch.

**Observations:**

1. No noticeable changes observed regarding the spaghetti's physical texture, color, or cooking time under symphony exposure.
2. Symphony No. 40 appeared to incite peculiar 'dance' movements in Bag 4 before settling down into mundane boiling behavior. Further investigation required.
3. Symphony No. 41 led to a seemingly faster cooking time by 34.56 seconds in Bag 5. Unclear whether it was due to the 'Jupiter' influence or human error while setting the timer.

**Conclusion:** 

Inconclusive evidence on the Mozart effect on boiling pasta - most batches of spaghetti, under the influence of classical music, have remained admirably stoic, maintaining their physical properties in spite of the harmonic persuasion. However, the potential accelerated cooking time under Symphony No. 41 and the inexplicable pasta 'dance' during Symphony No. 40 warrants further absurd exploration.

**Next Steps:** 

1. Replicate the study with other types of pasta – Fusilli, Linguine, Tortellini to name a few.
2. Experiment with other classical composers – Beethoven, Bach, Handel, and not so classical classic - Frank Zappa.
3. Explore potential reactions with other cooking processes – grilling, sautéing, frying under the influence of music.
4. Consider investing in a more accurate timer.

🧠 **AI Threat Recon Lore:**  
In the shadows of the digital battlefield, dark activity sparks alarm. A rogue Hikvision cam, SSH exposure and a vulnerable MongoDB lay bare, whilst an open RDP invites disaster like an unflagged minefield. On these grim frontlines, a critical SCADA system teeters on the brink, compelled towards chaos. Alarm systems simmer on a tense edge, as the insidious eye of a License Plate Reader at 94.139.167.167 prowls for prey in the dense matrix of cybernetic warfare.
